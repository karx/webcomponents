## <kaaro-pokemon>
A wild pokemon webcomponent


## How to run

* Directly by refering to the js file in this github repo. This repo is also hosted via github pages,
[https://karx.github.io/webcomponents/Pokemon/script.js](https://karx.github.io/webcomponents/Pokemon/script.js)

```
<script type="module" src="https://karx.github.io/webcomponents/Pokemon/script.js"></script>   
```


* By hosting this file yourself. After cloning, I personally use http-server from the root of the repository and enable cors
```
http-server Pokemon/. --cors=*
```

Then can use 
```
<script type="module" src="http://localhost:8080/script.js"></script>   
```
